Before bringing Token Fleet to life, we made sure our code was tested, reviewed, and verified by experts.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude97 Why Smart Contract Audits Matter\\n\\nAt Token Fleet, smart contracts handle:\\n\\n- Fractional car ownership\\n- Rental income tracking\\n- User rewards and income distribution\\n- Secure, transparent asset management\\n\\nThis is why we invested in a full **security review** of our system. It\u2019s not just about trust, it\u2019s about ensuring that every user interaction is protected by solid code.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd0d Audit Highlights\\n\\n- **769 lines of Solidity code** reviewed\\n- **67/67 tests passed**, zero failed\\n- **No critical vulnerabilities**\\n- **1 High** issue: **Fixed**\\n- **2 Medium** issues: **1 Fixed, 1 Acknowledged**\\n- **2 Low** issues: **Acknowledged**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd25 Fixed Issues\\n\\n1. **Fundraising Target Logic**  \\n   Corrected to ensure that all contributions are tracked accurately. \\n\\n2. **Reward Claiming Accuracy**  \\n   Now ensures users always receive full rewards, without loss from rounding errors. \\n\\n---\\n\\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Acknowledged Issues\\n\\n1. **Referral Rewards**  \\n   Referral rewards could lock if a user has no referrer. Our system enforces referrers on signup to avoid this.  \\n\\n2. **Deal Deadlines**  \\n   Deals can close after a deadline if users don\u2019t cancel. Deadlines serve as user protection, not a strict blocker.  \\n\\n3. **Portfolio Approval Flexibility**  \\n   Token approvals can currently be handled through a low-level function. This is functional and may be improved later.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc4 Full Audit Report\\n\\nFor those who like details, the full audit report is available here:  \\n\ud83d\udc49 [tokenfleet.io/audit](https://tokenfleet.io/audit)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What This Means for You\\n\\nThis audit proves that:\\n\\n- **Security is not an afterthought**\\n- **Ownership and rental income are protected**\\n- **Smart contracts are reliable and transparent**\\n\\nWe\u2019re building a platform where **real cars meet real returns**. You can trust the technology behind your investments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nWe\u2019re almost ready to launch.
