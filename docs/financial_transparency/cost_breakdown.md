Cost Breakdown and Revenue Sharing

At Token Fleet, transparency is key. This page details the costs involved in adding a car to our platform and how revenues are shared between the company and our investors.

Initial Investment Breakdown

When we list a car on our platform, the total investment includes:

	1.	Vehicle Purchase Price (X): The base cost of the car.
	2.	Company Fee (10% of X): Supports company operations like marketing, platform development, and administration.
	3.	Security Deposit (10% of X):
	•	Purpose: Covers maintenance, unexpected expenses, and all car-associated costs.
	•	Return Policy: Returned to investors at the end of the investment term, less any unreplenished expenses.
	4.	Insurance Costs: Variable depending on the car, providing comprehensive coverage.
	5.	Fixed Annual Costs:
	•	Registration fees
	•	GPS installation and maintenance
	•	Parking and storage fees
	•	Other annual expenses

Example

	•	Car Purchase Price (X): $50,000
	•	Company Fee (10% of X): $5,000
	•	Security Deposit (10% of X): $5,000
	•	Insurance Costs: $2,000
	•	Fixed Annual Costs: $1,000

Total Initial Investment: $50,000 + $5,000 + $5,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $63,000

Revenue from Rentals

Each time the car is rented, the rental income is divided as follows:

	•	Company Share (20%): Supports operations, customer service, and ensures high-quality service.
	•	Marketing and Maintenance Fund (10%):
	•	Usage: Funds car marketing efforts, detailing, and minor maintenance.
	•	Goal: Keeps the car in top condition and attractive to renters.
	•	Investor Share (70%): Distributed among investors proportionally based on their investment.

Example

	•	Monthly Rental Income: $4,000

Distribution:

	•	Company Share (20%): 20% of $4,000 = $800
	•	Marketing and Maintenance Fund (10%): 10% of $4,000 = $400
	•	Investor Share (70%): 70% of $4,000 = $2,800

Replenishing the Security Deposit

If funds are used from the security deposit for maintenance or unexpected expenses, replenishment is prioritized:

	1.	First Priority: Rental income is used to refill the security deposit back to its original amount.
	2.	After Replenishment: Once the security deposit is full, the standard revenue distribution resumes.

Example Scenario

	•	Used from Security Deposit: $1,000 for unexpected repairs.
	•	Next Month’s Rental Income: $4,000

Replenishment:

	•	Allocate $1,000 to replenish the security deposit.

Remaining Rental Income: $4,000 - $1,000 = $3,000

Distribution of Remaining Income:

	•	Company Share (20%): 20% of $3,000 = $600
	•	Marketing and Maintenance Fund (10%): 10% of $3,000 = $300
	•	Investor Share (70%): 70% of $3,000 = $2,100

Sale of the Car

At the end of the investment term or when the car is sold, proceeds are distributed as follows:

	•	Company Share (10%): Ensures we maintain the car’s value and condition throughout the investment period.
	•	Investors’ Return:
	•	Security Deposit Return: Initial security deposit is returned to investors, less any unreplenished expenses.
	•	Investors’ Share (90%): 90% of the sale price, distributed proportionally.

Example

	•	Sale Price: $40,000
	•	Unreplenished Security Deposit Expenses: $0 (fully replenished)

Distribution:

	•	Company Share (10%): 10% of $40,000 = $4,000
	•	Investors’ Share (90%): 90% of $40,000 = $36,000
	•	Return of Security Deposit: $5,000

Total Returned to Investors: $36,000 + $5,000 = $41,000

Summary of Investor Returns

Investors benefit from:

	1.	Rental Income: Receive 70% of rental income, distributed according to investment proportion.
	2.	Sale Proceeds: Get 90% of the car’s sale price at the end of the term.
