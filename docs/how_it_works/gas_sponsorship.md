# ⛽ Gas Sponsorship

Token Fleet provides **automatic gas sponsorship** to ensure a seamless transaction experience for all users on our platform, even those with limited ETH for transaction fees.

## 🔄 How Gas Sponsorship Works

### Eligibility Criteria

- **💰 Balance Check**: The system automatically checks if your wallet contains less than **0.00008 ETH**.
- **⏱️ Time Restriction**: A minimum of **3 days** must pass between sponsorships to the same user.

### Sponsorship Process

- **🔍 Automatic Detection**: When you initiate a transaction on our platform, our system checks your wallet balance.
- **💸 Gas Transfer**: If eligible, we automatically transfer **0.00002 ETH** to your wallet.
- **✅ Transaction Continuation**: The transaction then proceeds normally with the newly added funds covering the gas fees.

## 🌟 Benefits of Gas Sponsorship

- **🚪 Accessibility**: Ensures all users can interact with our platform regardless of their ETH holdings.
- **🔄 Seamless Experience**: No need to manually acquire small amounts of ETH just for transaction fees.
- **🚀 Reduced Friction**: Eliminates one of the common barriers to blockchain interaction.

## 📌 Important Notes

> 📝 Gas sponsorship is designed as a convenience feature, not as a source of ETH funding.

- ⚠️ The sponsorship amount (0.00002 ETH) is calculated to cover basic transaction costs.
- ⏰ The 3-day cooldown period helps prevent misuse of the sponsorship system.
- 💡 Users are encouraged to maintain sufficient ETH for transaction fees when possible.
