# KYC/AML Procedures

At Token Fleet, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Our robust KYC/AML procedures ensure that our platform operates within the bounds of the law and protects the integrity of our investors' funds. We are integrated with [Sumsub](https://sumsub.com/) for this.

## Customer Identification Program (CIP)

Our Customer Identification Program (CIP) is the foundation of our KYC/AML compliance framework:

1. **Identity Verification:** All users are required to provide valid government-issued identification documents, such as a passport or national ID card, to verify their identity.

2. **Enhanced Due Diligence:** For high-risk users or transactions, we may require additional documentation or conduct enhanced due diligence to mitigate potential risks.

## Risk-Based Approach

We employ a risk-based approach to KYC/AML compliance, tailoring our procedures to the specific risks associated with different user profiles and transactions:

1. **Risk Assessment:** We conduct regular risk assessments to identify and categorize potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with our platform.

2. **Transaction Monitoring:** Our system continuously monitors user transactions for suspicious activities, such as unusual transaction patterns or large volume transactions, and flags them for further review.

3. **Sanctions Screening:** We screen all users and transactions against international sanctions lists to ensure compliance with global AML regulations.

## Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting

Our KYC/AML compliance efforts extend beyond the initial onboarding process:

1. **Periodic Reviews:** We conduct periodic reviews of user accounts to ensure that the information on file remains up-to-date and accurate.

2. **Suspicious Activity Reporting:** If we detect any suspicious activities or transactions, we file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the relevant authorities, as required by law.

3. **Record Retention:** We maintain comprehensive records of user information and transactions for a specified period, as mandated by applicable regulations.

## Staff Training and Awareness

To ensure the effective implementation of our KYC/AML procedures, we invest in the training and awareness of our staff:

1. **Regular Training:** All employees undergo regular training on KYC/AML best practices, regulatory requirements, and our internal compliance policies.

2. **Compliance Culture:** We foster a culture of compliance throughout our organization, emphasizing the importance of adherence to KYC/AML procedures at all levels.

## Independent Audits and Reviews

To validate the effectiveness of our KYC/AML procedures, we subject our compliance framework to regular independent audits and reviews:

1. **Third-Party Audits:** We engage reputable, independent auditors to assess our KYC/AML procedures and provide recommendations for improvement.

2. **Regulatory Reviews:** We cooperate fully with regulatory authorities during any reviews or investigations, providing all necessary documentation and information.

At Token Fleet, we are dedicated to upholding the highest standards of KYC/AML compliance to protect our investors, our platform, and the integrity of the global financial system. If you have any questions or concerns about our KYC/AML procedures, please contact our compliance team.
