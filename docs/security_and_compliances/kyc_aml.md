# KYC/AML Procedures

Token Fleet is dedicated to maintaining high standards of compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Our robust KYC/AML procedures protect our platformâ€™s integrity and safeguard investor funds, and we partner with [Sumsub](https://sumsub.com/) for enhanced compliance solutions.

## Customer Identification Program (CIP)

Our Customer Identification Program (CIP) forms the foundation of our KYC/AML compliance framework:

1. **Identity Verification**: Users provide government-issued ID documents, such as a passport or national ID card, to verify their identity.

2. **Enhanced Due Diligence**: For higher-risk users or transactions, we may request additional documentation or conduct further due diligence to minimize risks.

## Risk-Based Approach

We use a risk-based approach to tailor our procedures based on different user profiles and transaction types:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Regular assessments identify and categorize potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with our platform.

2. **Transaction Monitoring**: Our system monitors transactions for suspicious patterns or high volumes, flagging these for further review.

3. **Sanctions Screening**: Users and transactions are screened against international sanctions lists to ensure global AML compliance.

## Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting

Our compliance efforts extend beyond onboarding:

1. **Periodic Reviews**: We conduct regular reviews of user accounts to ensure that account information remains accurate and up-to-date.

2. **Suspicious Activity Reporting**: If suspicious activities are detected, we file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with relevant authorities as required by law.

3. **Record Retention**: We maintain comprehensive records of user information and transactions as mandated by regulations.

## Staff Training and Awareness

We invest in staff training to ensure effective KYC/AML implementation:

1. **Regular Training**: Employees receive ongoing training on KYC/AML best practices, regulatory requirements, and our internal policies.

2. **Compliance Culture**: We promote a culture of compliance organization-wide, emphasizing adherence to KYC/AML standards.

## Independent Audits and Reviews

We validate our KYC/AML processes through regular audits:

1. **Third-Party Audits**: Reputable, independent auditors assess our procedures and provide recommendations.

2. **Regulatory Reviews**: We fully cooperate with regulatory authorities during any reviews or investigations.

Token Fleet is committed to the highest standards of KYC/AML compliance, safeguarding both investors and platform integrity. For inquiries, please contact our compliance team.
